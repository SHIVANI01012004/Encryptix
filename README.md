This SPAM SMS CLASSIFIER demonstrates NLP techniques in text classification using a dataset of SMS messages. Leveraging Naive Bayes and SVM algorithms, it showcases ML's role in spam detection.
A bank customer churn prediction model was developed. Various EDA and preprocessing steps were carried out, Number of ML algorithms tested and the better performing algorithm was selected for modelling and the hyper parmaeters tuned. Finally testing the model on unseen data to evaluate it
A credit card fraud detectionn model was developed employ machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine. The accuracy results in detecting fraudulent transactions appears promising.
